/--------------------------ADC peripheral explanation--------------------------------------
//PA0 and PA1 are analog input pins connected to measure battery voltage
//We assume that at PA0 pin (ADC_VOLT point) will be 16 bit battery voltage value
//at PA1 (ADC_VOLT_IN) will be 12 bit battery voltage value
//PA4 pin (ADC_TEMP1 point) is connected to voltage divider made by 10k resistor and thermistor in series
//PA5 pin (ADC_TEMP2 point) is connected aslo to simmilar voltage divider
//F_CPU is 16 MHz and we need to divide that value to cca 125 kHz to form ADCCLK
//for this purpose, we will use ADCx_SMPRx register (SMPx [2:0]) that holds the value how many cycles will th system sample
//any value and ADCx_CCR register (ADCPRE[17:16]) SMPx = 001 (15 cycles), ADCPRE = 11 ( PCK2 / 8) 
//ADCCLK -> 16 MHz / (15*8) = 133.3 kHz 
//We will allign data to the right so ALIGH bit in ADCx_CR2 will be cleared to 0, VREF is 2.56 V internally

//--------------------------System Nofitications----------------------------------------------
//type 0 for false ondition and 1 for true condition

//--------------------------TIM1 peripheral explanation---------------------------------------
//TIM1 is used to generate clock signal with frquency about 8 Hz, timer mode will be clear at compare match
