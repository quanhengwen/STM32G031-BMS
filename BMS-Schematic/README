Battery management system controlled by STM32G031K632 bit 
microcontroller, the system has three separated units, 
power supply, analog digital conversion peripheral
and communication unit. 

Power supply is connected directly to batteries meaning 
that we do not need additional external power source.
Power supply main part is Texas Instruments integrated 
circuit TPS6107x which stands as a buck/boost converter 
generating stable 700mA and 3.3V at the output. All 4.7uF 
capacitors connceted to TPS6107x chip are used to give the 
maximum power at the output. Two 4.7uF capacitors instead 
of one 10uF capacitor are better solution due to less 
noise value generation.
